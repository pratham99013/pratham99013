## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hey there! I'm Pratham Mishra, currently pursuing my B.Tech. in Information Technology at Madan Mohan Malaviya University of Technology, Gorakhpur. Currently in my third year.
I've delved deeply into the world of technology, specializing in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) with a focus on C++, and mastering Full Stack Web Development using tools like React.js, Django & SQLite among others. 
I'm driven by a profound passion for coding and thrive in the fast-paced world of competitive programming and development. Always on the lookout for challenges to conquer and projects to innovate upon, I'm actively seeking internship and placement opportunities where I can leverage my skills and enthusiasm to make meaningful contributions.
